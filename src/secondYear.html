                            <h1>First Ever Co-op</h1>
                            <p>The most impact experience for me this year is working as an intern for my first co-op, I
                                am lucky enough to land a job as quality assurance for Fox Sports Cincinnati. Even
                                though that I was not my dream job, and I was not satisfied with what I have achieved
                                for my first co-op experience, it is still the best thing that happen to me in this
                                year.
                                I always imagine myself working as back-end software developer who will spend all day
                                reading and writing codes, so landing the quality assurance job was not the best ideal
                                job I could get, I mostly spent my day testing website making it run perfectly. But
                                luckily I met a great supervisor who taught me a lot about communication in professional
                                workplace, and because as a first year intern, I have a lot of free time after finishing
                                my work, my supervisor let me work on a small portion of back-end development work so I
                                can experience the work that I really want to do.
                                When the Covid-19 pandemic hit Ohio, I heard some students had to end the co-op semester
                                early because of it, but we was lucky enough to be given a change to work from home, and
                                that was the first time I experienced the difficulty of working from home. I am always
                                ready to do any work in the office but when I started working from home, there were so
                                many distractions around me, starting some work got harder and harder, that is when I
                                realized I need to come up with solution to disconnect myself from distractions. I
                                started separate my work and home computer to make sure when I work, there will be no
                                application or website that I need to open when I use my home computer, that helped me
                                concentrate on what I need to be done.
                                I met a lot of friends who were also co-op students as me, and I learned a lot from
                                them, from how they work, how they communicate with each other. I met those who were
                                upperclassmen in my major and learned a lot about classes I would take for summer
                                semester, and they also helped me know more about my dream job.
                                Even though not being able to land my dream job, I got a chance to experience another
                                piece in my tech world and worked with amazing people from my workplace. I love working
                                as back-end developer but always doubt myself if I really enjoy it when I work on it,
                                and having an opportunity to have a small work on it at work was great to assure I will
                                enjoy working on it.

                        ​Hi, welcome to my learning portfolio, my name is Hao Truong, I am currently a Computer Science
                        at University of Cincinnati. I come from Vietnam and have been here since 2016, I speak
                        Vietnamese and still in progress with my English. I wanted to develop my leadership skills when
                        I applied to University Honor Program and also learn more about myself and how I can contribute
                        myself into the world. ​I have been in love with computer since I was a little kid. I love
                        computer language because it gathers everyone around the world into the same language that we
                        can all understand. My goal is improving myself in computer field to create new technology for
                        the world and using it to discover our own limit.
