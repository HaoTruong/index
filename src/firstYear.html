                            <p>This is a small drawing I did while having a Calculus II lecture in spring semester
                                of 2019, it is
                                somehow
                                representing me as a first-year student coming to University of Cincinnati, running away
                                from deadlines
                                I
                                would call it. I was overwhelmed with amount of homework, project that I need to be done
                                in
                                the end of
                                every
                                semester, and studying as less as I used to do in high school did not help; Studying
                                alone
                                also did not
                                help. Waking up early and staying up late for studying seems to be something normal to a
                                college student
                                which I do not like. However, beside from being stress out from studying, being in
                                lectures,
                                working on
                                a
                                project, first-year experience was a great year after all. It shaped me into a better
                                version of myself
                                that
                                I completely love it and way better than a goal I put out in the beginning of the year.
                                I
                                used to keep
                                everything to myself and sharing it out was a big deal to me, but I met friends who I
                                can
                                share, talk
                                and
                                study with.
                                I learned a lot of new things from first year, social issues I learned from Honor
                                Gateway
                                have the most
                                value to me for the whole year including all classes that I took. I grown up more than I
                                expected, I
                                start
                                to think about everything happens around me more than just myself, and it motivates me
                                to
                                get out there
                                and
                                solve others problem more than just my problem; I want to work for something that is
                                bigger
                                than myself.

                        ​Hi, welcome to my learning portfolio, my name is Hao Truong, I am currently a Computer Science
                        at University of Cincinnati. I come from Vietnam and have been here since 2016, I speak
                        Vietnamese and still in progress with my English. I wanted to develop my leadership skills when
                        I applied to University Honor Program and also learn more about myself and how I can contribute
                        myself into the world. ​I have been in love with computer since I was a little kid. I love
                        computer language because it gathers everyone around the world into the same language that we
                        can all understand. My goal is improving myself in computer field to create new technology for
                        the world and using it to discover our own limit.
